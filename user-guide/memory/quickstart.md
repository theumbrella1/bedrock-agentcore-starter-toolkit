# Getting Started with AgentCore Memory

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory lets you create and manage memory resources that store conversation context for your AI agents. This section guides you through installing dependencies and implementing both short-term and long-term memory features.

The steps are as follows

1. Create a memory resource containing a semantic strategy
1. Write events (conversation history) to the memory resource.
1. Retrieve memory records from long term memory

## Prerequisites

### Before starting, make sure you have:

- **AWS Account** with credentials configured (`aws configure`)
- **Python 3.10+** installed

To get started with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory, make a folder for this quick start, create a virtual environment, and install the dependencies. The below command can be run directly in the terminal.

```
mkdir agentcore-memory-quickstart
cd agentcore-memory-quickstart
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install bedrock-agentcore
pip install bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit
```

**Note:** The AgentCore Starter Toolkit is intended to help developers get started quickly. For the complete set of AgentCore Memory operations, see the Boto3 documentation: [bedrock-agentcore-control](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore-control.html) and [bedrock-agentcore](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agentcore.html).

**Full example:** See the [complete code example](../../examples/semantic_search.html) that demonstrates steps 1-3.

## Step One: Create a Memory Resource

A memory resource is needed to start storing information for your agent. By default, memory events (which we refer to as short-term memory) can be written to a memory resource. In order for insights to be extracted and placed into long term memory records, the resource requires a 'memory strategy' - a configuration that defines how conversational data should be processed, and what information to extract (such as facts, preferences, or summaries).

We are going to create a memory resource with a semantic strategy so that both short term and long term memory can be utilized. This will take 2-3 minutes. Memory resources can also be created in the AWS console.

```
from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit.operations.memory.manager import MemoryManager
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.session import MemorySessionManager
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import ConversationalMessage, MessageRole
from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit.operations.memory.models.strategies import SemanticStrategy
import time

memory_manager = MemoryManager(region_name="us-west-2")

print("Creating memory resource...")

memory = memory_manager.get_or_create_memory(
    name="CustomerSupportSemantic",
    description="Customer support memory store",
    strategies=[
        SemanticStrategy(
            name="semanticLongTermMemory",
            namespaces=['/strategies/{memoryStrategyId}/actors/{actorId}'],
        )
    ]
)

print(f"Memory ID: {memory.get('id')}")
```

You can call list_memories to see that the memory resource has been created with:

```
memories = memory_manager.list_memories()
```

## Step Two: Write events to memory

Writing events to memory has multiple purposes. First, event contents (most commonly conversation history) are stored as short term memory. Second, relevant insights are pulled from events and written into memory records as a part of long term memory.

The memory resource id, actor id, and session id are required to create an event. We are going to create three events, simulating messages between an end user and a chat bot.

```
# Create a session to store memory events
session_manager = MemorySessionManager(
    memory_id=memory.get("id"),
    region_name="us-west-2")

session = session_manager.create_memory_session(
    actor_id="User1",
    session_id="OrderSupportSession1"
)

# Write memory events (conversation turns)
session.add_turns(
    messages=[
        ConversationalMessage(
            "Hi, how can I help you today?",
            MessageRole.ASSISTANT)],
)

session.add_turns(
    messages=[
        ConversationalMessage(
            "Hi, I am a new customer. I just made an order, but it hasn't arrived. The Order number is #35476",
            MessageRole.USER)],
)

session.add_turns(
    messages=[
        ConversationalMessage(
            "I'm sorry to hear that. Let me look up your order.",
            MessageRole.ASSISTANT)],
)
```

You can get events (turns) for a specific actor after they’ve been written.

```
# Get the last k turns in the session
turns = session.get_last_k_turns(k=5)

for turn in turns:
    print(f"Turn: {turn}")
```

In this case, we can see the last three events for the actor and session.

## Step Three: Retrieve records from long term memory

After the events were written to the memory resource, they were analyzed and useful information was sent to long term memory. Since the memory contains a semantic long term memory strategy, the system extracts and stores factual information.

You can list all memory records with:

```
# List all memory records
memory_records = session.list_long_term_memory_records(
    namespace_prefix="/"
)

for record in memory_records:
    print(f"Memory record: {record}")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
```

Or ask for the most relevant information as part of a semantic search:

```
# Perform a semantic search
memory_records = session.search_long_term_memories(
    query="can you summarize the support issue",
    namespace_prefix="/",
    top_k=3
)
```

Important information about the user is likely stored is long term memory. Agents can use long term memory rather than a full conversation history to make sure that LLMs are not overloaded with context.

## Cleanup

When you're done with the memory resource, you can delete it:

```
# Delete the memory resource
memory_manager.delete_memory(memory_id=memory.get("id"))
```

## What’s Next?

Consider the following as you continue your AgentCore journey

- Add another strategy to your memory resource
- Enable observability for more visibility into how memory is working
- Look at the vast collection of samples to familiarize yourself with other use cases.
